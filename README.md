This repository contains the ten projects I worked on while I was taking CSE2331: Software II at OSU. They are all written in Java.
Below is a short description of the instructions I was given for the project, which also explains what exactly the project should be doing:
1. Counts word occurrences in a given input file and outputs an HTML document with a table of the words and counts listed in alphabetical order.
2. Complete and carefully test implementations of all the constructors and kernel methods defined in interface NaturalNumberKernel, building the data structure representing a NaturalNumber object by layering it on top of java.lang.String
3. Complete and carefully test implementations of all the constructors and kernel methods defined in interface MapKernel, building the data structure representing a Map object by layering it on top of an array of Map itself. The algorithmic approach is to use hashing to immediately narrow every search to a much smaller Map
4. Complete and carefully test implementations of the constructor and all kernel methods defined in interface SetKernel, building the data structure representing a Set object by layering it on top of BinaryTree.
5. Complete and carefully test implementations of the constructor and all kernel methods defined in interface SortingMachineKernel, building the data structure representing a SortingMachine object by layering it on top of Queue and arrays. The algorithmic approach is to use the heapsort sorting algorithm.
6. Complete and carefully test implementations of the constructor and all kernel methods defined in interface ListKernel plus the methods retreat and moveToFinish defined in interface List, by building a representation that involves a doubly-linked list of nodes using Java references.
7. Complete and carefully test implementations of the constructor and kernel methods defined in interfaces ProgramKernel and StatementKernel.
8. Complete and carefully test an implementation of a recursive-descent parser for the BL language. The parser must follow the context-free-grammar for the BL language.
9. Write a Java program that generates a tag cloud/word cloud from a given input text
10. Generates the number of most used words in a .txt file and outputs it in an html file. The number of words is chosen by the user.
